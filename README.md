In comparison  to RT-PCR ,Computed Tomography (CT) is more reliable, useful and quicker technology for classification and assessment of COVID-19.


The low sensitivity RT-PCR test is not satisfactory for present pandemic situation .The Infected can  be sometimes assigned as    false negative 
Hence automated analysis of CT pictures is desirable to save valuable time of medical staff and also avoids delay in starting treatment

Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) used for diagnosing COVID-19 has been found to give low detection rate during early stages of infection. Radiological analysis of CT images has given higher prediction rate when compared to RT-PCR technique.
