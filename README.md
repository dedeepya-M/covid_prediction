In comparison  to RT-PCR ,Computed Tomography (CT) is more reliable, useful and quicker technology for classification and assessment of COVID-19.


The low sensitivity RT-PCR test is not satisfactory for present pandemic situation .The Infected can  be sometimes assigned as    false negative 
Hence automated analysis of CT pictures is desirable to save valuable time of medical staff and also avoids delay in starting treatment
